— Richard Feynman     

##Diving In


Every programming language has that one feature, a complicated thing intentionally made simple. If you’re coming from another language, you could easily miss it, because your old language didn’t make that thing simple (because it was busy making something else simple instead). This chapter will teach you about list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions: three related concepts centered around one very powerful technique. But first, I want to take a little detour into two modules that will help you navigate your local file system.
